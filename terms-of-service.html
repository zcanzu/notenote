        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By downloading, installing, or using the NoteNote mobile application (“App”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). 
            If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            NoteNote is a mobile application that allows two users to pair their devices using a short-lived QR code or 6-digit match code, and share notes and drawings in real time. 
            Shared content appears instantly through the App and the home screen widget.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App does not require user accounts, email registration, passwords, or personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>
            The App is intended for users aged 4 and above. If you are under 18, you represent that you have parental or guardian permission to use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Matching and Temporary Identifiers</h2>

        <h3>4.1 No Account Registration</h3>
        <p>
            The App does not require creating an account, providing an email, or signing in. 
            When you start using the App, a random temporary technical identifier may be generated locally on your device for the sole purpose of establishing a match with another user.
            This identifier is not linked to your identity.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Matching</h3>
        <p>To match with another user, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan their QR code, or</li>
            <li>Share your QR code, or</li>
            <li>Enter a 6-digit temporary match code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once matched, both users can send and receive notes and drawings until the match expires or is manually ended.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Match Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot match with yourself.</li>
            <li>You can only have one active match at a time.</li>
            <li>Match codes expire after a short period for security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Content</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Ownership</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of all notes, drawings, and content you create (“User Content”).</p>

        <h3>5.2 License</h3>
        <p>
            You grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to store, transmit, and display your content solely to operate the App and deliver your content to your matched partner.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Prohibited Content</h3>
        <p>You agree not to upload or share content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, hateful, harassing, pornographic, or that violates others’ rights.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Content Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You may delete your notes at any time.  
            When a match ends or expires, all shared content is removed from our active systems.  
            Limited technical logs or backups may remain temporarily for security and stability.
        </p>
