        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By downloading, installing, or using the NoteNote mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            NoteNote is a mobile application that allows two users to connect and share notes, drawings, and messages in real-time. The App enables users to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and share text notes with a matched partner</li>
            <li>Create and share drawings/images with a matched partner</li>
            <li>Connect with another user through a unique code or QR code</li>
            <li>Receive real-time notifications when your partner updates their note</li>
            <li>View shared content through a home screen widget</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The App is provided free of charge. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time without prior notice.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>
            The App is intended for users aged 4 and above. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you are at least 4 years old. If you are under the age of 18, you represent that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>4. User Accounts and Matching</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>
            When you first use the App, a unique user account is automatically created. You are assigned a unique 6-character code that expires after 30 seconds. This code is used to match with another user.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Matching Process</h3>
        <p>
            To use the App, you must match with another user by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharing your unique code with another user, or</li>
            <li>Scanning another user's QR code, or</li>
            <li>Entering another user's code manually</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once matched, you and your partner can share notes and drawings. Each match (channel) has an expiration time that you can set (1-12 hours). After expiration, the match automatically ends.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Matching Restrictions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot match with yourself</li>
            <li>You can only have one active match at a time</li>
            <li>You cannot match with the same user immediately after a match ends</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Content and Responsibilities</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Content Ownership</h3>
        <p>
            You retain ownership of all content you create, upload, or share through the App ("User Content"), including text notes and drawings. However, by using the App, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, transmit, and display your User Content solely for the purpose of providing the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Prohibited Content</h3>
        <p>
            You agree not to create, upload, or share any User Content that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or invasive of another's privacy</li>
            <li>Contains hate speech, discrimination, or promotes violence</li>
            <li>Is sexually explicit, pornographic, or obscene</li>
            <li>Infringes upon intellectual property rights of others</li>
            <li>Contains malware, viruses, or other harmful code</li>
            <li>Violates any applicable laws or regulations</li>
            <li>Is intended to harm or exploit minors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Content Moderation</h3>
        <p>
            While we do not actively monitor User Content, we reserve the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove any User Content that violates these Terms</li>
            <li>Suspend or terminate accounts that repeatedly violate these Terms</li>
            <li>Report illegal content to appropriate authorities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We are not responsible for User Content and do not endorse any User Content shared through the App.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4 Content Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You can delete your own notes at any time. When you delete a note, it is removed from the shared channel. However, your partner may have already viewed or saved the content before deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a match expires or ends, all shared content is automatically deleted from our servers. We do not retain User Content after a match ends.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            When you match with another user, your User Content (notes and drawings) is shared with your matched partner. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text notes you create</li>
            <li>Drawings/images you create</li>
            <li>Your display name (if set)</li>
            <li>Timestamps of when content was created or updated</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your matched partner can view all content you share in the active match. We do not share your content with any third parties except as described in our <a href="https://zcanzu.github.io/notenote/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
